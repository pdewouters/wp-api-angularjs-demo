wp-api-angularjs-demo
=====================

Demo angularJS app using the WP API.

This is a beta app :)

This app offers a one page app which will display a list of your starred Github repos, with filter controls and a tagging system.

It contains an importer for your starred Github repositories. The code is commented out.

Requires a fork of the WP API , in order to manage custom taxonomy terms for custom post types.
Requires the WP API AngularJS client by Jeff Sebring.

You'll need to run `npm install`, `bower install` and `composer install` to fetch the dependencies.

I'll probably write a blog post with better instructions at some point.

Pagination has not yet been implemented.
